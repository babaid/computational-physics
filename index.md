# Welcome friend!

The aim behind this website is to provide a well-structured overview over the topics of computational physics somehow following the computational physics lecture at TUM. 


## Shortcomings of the TUM lecture

The lecture at TUM has only slightly improved over the years and does't really teach anything besides rushing through every topic week by week.

Other shortcomings of the course are that it further drives the wedge into the two language (hell even 3) problem, trying to teach students (with ~0 experience) C, and then somehow mixing it up with python if they feel like it. 

For the sake of confusing beginners even more, the provided C code comes with makefiles, which is considered less then modern these days. 

Keep in mind, the students have one week for this, which is funny because even real software engineers need more time to master C/C++.

Some have tried to say "Duh this lecture just tries to provide a rough overview of the tools which researchers at other groups are working with!". You're absolutely right, it should! Going through the notes over and over we realized that no reference was made to who is using a corresponding alorithm/approach or where I could learn more about it.


These are the main reasons we created this page. 

## What this course is

The real goal behind an introductory course to computational physics should be first of all to combine algorithmic approaches with scientific problems and second of all to show students where to look for more information on a topic if it interests them. Of course this can be glazed with optional group projects and alike, but lets not take it too far.

With this in mind, we will try to include as many references to other TUM lectures which go deeper into each topic as possible and also give you different algorithms in different programming languages.

We will also include notes on why you could consider one approach or language over the other, also referring to literature of course so you can make up your own mind. 



## What this course is not

This is not a coding course. If you need to learn coding look somewhere else (Tutorialspoint, Freecodecamp, Codecademy) or be brave. 


This is also no software architecture or engineering course, at each point where we consider an approach wich requires advanced knowledge on these topics we will mark it and refer to some literature and provide a fall-back version in case you're only interested in the minimal working prototype (or you procrastinated too much and tomorrow is exam day :/ )
